# Machine Learning and Quantitative Trading - Session 10

## Options
Its price calculation is according to optimization theory. If your optimization theory is correct, then your will get profit from options is definitely. 

## Quant Platform
If you programming skill is not very good, can start from open source platform. 

## Recommend Paper
1. Stock Price Forecasting using Support Vector Machines and Improved Particle Swarm Optimization - 2013 (The PSO filter is the derivation of GA, it is useful for time series data, sometimes better than Kalman filter)

## Imbalanced classification in ML
This is the big issue in machine learning, recommend to read in [imbalanced classification](https://machinelearningmastery.com/what-is-imbalanced-classification/)

## Great Example
[Orderbook-dynamics - Github](https://github.com/ezhulenev/orderbook-dynamics)

## Model could fit big data
What kind of model can fit big data? 
1. Simple model: eg, logistic regression
2. NN model: with complexity, but it allow parallel processing
3. RF model: it allow parallel processing

Medium size data (ten thousand data size)
1. SVM
2. Base on Bayesian theory model

**Important** SVM could not handle ten million data, but Deep NN can, DNN may not super good than linear model if you have not big data. Eg, when you have million data, then SVM or linear may be better than NN, but if you have big data, then DNN could feed them and analysis more features.

## How to prepare your resume
1. Prepare master resume
2. Github

## How to prepare your (non-tech) interveiw
请介绍你自己三分钟：留一些可以被问的问题（你的强项）

- 选择说明以下关系的三种工作情况：
   - 领导/团队
   - 主动/动机
   - 问题解决、计划和组织
   - 一次困难/失败 （项目中， 体量突然增大了 ，60%要说你怎么处理的和怎么解决这个困难）
 - 您的叙述应该：
   - 有开头、中间和结尾
   - 按照STAR方法 situation+task+action+resutls
   - 说实话
   - 详细说 (提供详细信息)
