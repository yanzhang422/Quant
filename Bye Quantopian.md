# Goodbye 2020
![Quantopian Closing](https://github.com/yanzhang81/Quant/raw/master/Quantopian%20closing.PNG)
Quantopian, who has been accompanded with us 8 years, suddently announced its community services will be offline! Quantopian provides a set of quantitative learning courses with high quality,  it is one of my favorite quantitative courses.

## What Quantopian provides us
Quantopian (A quantitative strategy research platform) integrates a backtest framework, data interface and rich strategy templates. It is an enlightenment tool for many quantitative enthusiasts to enter the pit of quantitative research. With the expansion of machine learning algorithms in quantitative research, as an online platform, it is difficult to meet everyone's demand, especially in computing power, and it has flexibility limitation. 

But it has left many excellent projects in open source community:
- [Zipline]
As one of the earliest open source backtesting frameworks, its concept of event-driven backtesting has been popularized by most quantitative enthusiasts.
- [Alphalens]
A framework for factor testing and analysis, which conducts comprehensive testing and analysis of factors, it can generate detailed visual reports.
- [Pyfolio]
It is a toolkit for strategy performance evaluation. Pyfolio can return a wealth of strategy performance statistical indicators and charts. Empyrical is relatively lightweight and flexible, and can easily calculate indicators such as Sharpe ratio, Karma ratio and so on.

## Other quantative platform/projects
**Oversea**

Similiar to quantopian, WebSim is another platform (it also no longer available in 2019) from [Worldquant] who provides users with services including strategy writing, backtesting, etc. The difference lies in its quantitative investment analysis. [QuantConnect] is another platform which allow user moving quantopian code into.

## Tech
Beyond the getting started quantative tutorial, also recommend knowing the following basics:

### Python Programming
If you are unfamiliar with Python, here are some good resources:

* [CodeAcademy]
* LearnPython.org
* [Python Data Science Handbook]

And here are a few intermediate level resources:

* [Modern Pandas](https://tomaugspurger.github.io/modern-1-intro.html)
* [Losing your Loops Fast Numerical Computing with NumPy (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEUXKG97YRw)

### Finance/Investing
These are some good resources for learning the basics of financial and investing:

* [Overview of Stocks](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stock.asp)
* [Stocks and Bonds on KhanAcademy](https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/core-finance/stock-and-bonds)

## We lost Quantopian
We lost Quantopian in 2020. In the near future, there will have other quantitative platforms up and down. I don't know who can survive and stay, there are many uncertainties, but surely we have to keep studying.

**Again, Ciao Quantopian, We will miss you!**
